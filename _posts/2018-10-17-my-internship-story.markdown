<p> I will always remember the days I had at Autodesk.</p>
<p>I will never forget my daily haagen dazs and foosball practices.</p>
<p>I will never forget the evening when my project started working.</p>
<p>I will never forget all those interesting white boards designs we have done.</p>
<p>I will never forget all those rehearsals and practices for my intern presentation.</p>

## What have I done during my 12-week internship at Autodesk?
1. A full stack project 
    * Tech Stack: React, AWS, Autodesk Forge
    * Purpose: Internal tool for Agile related metrics, accessible to all agile coaches and leadership
    * Basic Functions: 
        * Able to auto fetch data, analyz and then push to front end weekly. 
        * User authentication using Autodesk Forge service.
        * Classified confidentail data visibility to different group of users.
    * Future Work: Build a machine learining model for predicting future performance of teams.


2. An inner source project
    * Tech Stack: React
    * Purpose: For sharing my experience of utilizing Autodesk HIG React Components and other best practices.
    * Bacis Functions: 
        * Examples of Autodesk HIG React Components as a complement to storybook. 
            * Charts.
            * How to combine multiple HIG Components. 
        * Examples of tests for React.
        * Examples of configurations for CI/CD pipelines. 
    * Future Work: The project is undergoing legal process for becoming open source.


3. An Artifactory monitoring system 
    * Tech Stack: Python, Groovy (Jenkins), Docker
    * Purpose: For monitoring the connection of Artifactory and Jenkins.
    * Basic Functions: 
        * Tests for logging Artifactory from Jenkins.
        * Tests for pulling generic Artifacts from Artifactory from Jenkins, acheived by testing in Python environment created from a Docker image on Jenkins.
        * Tests for pulling Docker images from Artifactory from Jenkins, acheived by testing directly on Jenkins.

## What I have learned from my internship at Autodesk?
1. Technical 
    * React
        * Pros: Reusable Components, No need to rerender whole page(Virtual DOM).
        * Cons: Too many lines of codes if moving to Redux (too many boilerplate codes). 
    * Jenkins/Docker/Artifactory
        * The brilliant architecture, cause it's not possible to test pulling a Docker image in a Docker environment.  
        * Got deeper knowledge of CI/CD pipelins and Docker.
        * Picked up how to write JenkinsFile and DockerFile. 
    * Best practices 
        * Test-driven development or paying tech debt.
        * Git/Collaboration.
        * Work in an iterative way. 
        * CI/CD.
        * Peer Programming and white board designs.

2. Professional
    * Work with multiple teams. 
        * Worked as a team member in Autodesk Agile&Transformation Team.
        * Worked closely with Autodesk HIG Team. 
        * Worked with security team of Autodesk Forge.
        * Worked with Autodesk Orchestration Team. 
    * Intern presentation
        * Presented 5min to leadership from Autodesk MCP and other guests. 
    * Intern Olympics
        * Played foosball representing MCP Department and made it to semi-quater.
