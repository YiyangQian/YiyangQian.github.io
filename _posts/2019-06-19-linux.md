## Alias
1. create 
    ```
    alias foo = "cd ..; ls; cd ..; ls"
    ```
2. delete
    ```
    unalias foo
    ```
3. Alias will be gone if the terminal is closed. To make these alias persistent, store them in bashrc/zshrc.
    ```
    nano .zshrc
    ```

## History
1. history of inputs
    ```
    history
    ```

## Details of a command
1. type of a command
    ```
    type ls
    ```
2. manual page of a command
    ```
    man ls
    ```
3. whatis
    ```
    whatis ls
    ```

## I/O Redirection
1. store output, if there is error, error will show in terminal and output.txt will not be written
    ```
    ls -l > output.txt
    ```
2. `>` is used to overwrite a file and `>>` is used to append a file
    ```
    ls -l >> output.txt
    ```

## Error Redirection
Types of I/O: 
* Standard Input - stdin - 0
* Standard Output - stdout - 1
* Standard Error - stderr - 2

Error messages are printed to standard error. `>` only redirects standard output, so standard error is still shown on the terminal. To redirect them:
1. stdout to one file and stderr to another file
    ```
    command > output.txt 2>error.txt
    ```
2. redirect stderr to stdout(&1)
    ```
    command >output.txt 2>&1
    ```
3. redirect both to a file
    ```
    command &> output.txt
    ```
