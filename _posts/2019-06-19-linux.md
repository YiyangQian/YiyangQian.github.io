## Alias
1. create 
    ```
    alias foo = "cd ..; ls; cd ..; ls"
    ```
2. delete
    ```
    unalias foo
    ```
3. Alias will be gone if the terminal is closed. To make these alias persistent, store them in bashrc/zshrc.
    ```
    nano .zshrc
    ```

## History
1. history of inputs
    ```
    history
    ```

## Details of a command
1. type of a command
    ```
    type ls
    ```
2. manual page of a command
    ```
    man ls
    ```
3. whatis
    ```
    whatis ls
    ```

## I/O Redirection
1. store output, if there is error, error will show in terminal and output.txt will not be written
    ```
    ls -l > output.txt
    ```
2. `>` is used to overwrite a file and `>>` is used to append a file
    ```
    ls -l >> output.txt
    ```

## Error Redirection
Types of I/O: 
* Standard Input - stdin - 0
* Standard Output - stdout - 1
* Standard Error - stderr - 2

Error messages are printed to standard error. `>` only redirects standard output, so standard error is still shown on the terminal. To redirect them:
1. stdout to one file and stderr to another file
    ```
    command >output.txt 2>error.txt
    ```
2. redirect stderr to stdout(&1)
    ```
    command >output.txt 2>&1
    ```
3. redirect both to a file
    ```
    command &> output.txt
    ```

## cat
1. open a file
    ```
    cat file.txt
    ```
2. create and write to a file, type `control` + `d` twice to exit.
    ```
    cat > test.txt
    ```
    
## pipelines and grep
1. the pipeline makes the last output as the input for next command.
    ```
    stdin | stdout
    ```
2. uniq
    ```
    ls | uniq
    ```
3. sort
    ```
    ls | uniq | sort
    ```
4. wc - word count
    ```
    wc -l : prints the number of lines in a file.
    wc -w : prints the number of words in a file.
    wc -c : prints the count of bytes in a file.
    wc -m : prints the count of characters from a file.
    wc -L : prints only the length of the longest line in a file.
    ```
5. grep
    ```
    ls | grep txt
    ```
6. head/tail -n shows first/last n lines
    ```
    head -n 5
    tail -n 5
    ```

## Echo
1. Echo will print matching files in current dir
    ```
    echo * : prints all files under current dir.
    echo D* : prints all files starting with D.
    echo [[:upper:]]* : all files starting with UpperCase.
    echo Five Divided By Two is $((5 / 2)) : Five Divided By Two is 2.
    ```
2. {}
    ```
    echo here {1..9}
    echo hey {Z..A}
    ```
3. `$`
    ```
    echo $(ls)
    ```

## Quotes and Exceptions
1. Exceptions
    ```
    `
    \
    $
    ```
2. `""` and `''`
    ```
    echo example ~/P* $(echo test) $((2 + 2)) $USER
    Output: example /Users/yiyang/Parallels /Users/yiyang/Pictures /Users/yiyang/Public test 4 yiyang

    echo "example ~/P* $(echo test) $((2 + 2)) $USER"
    Output: example ~/P* test 4 yiyang

    echo 'example ~/P* $(echo test) $((2 + 2)) $USER'
    Output: example ~/P* $(echo test) $((2 + 2)) $USER
    ```

## Environment Variables
1. printenv shows environment variables
2. export
    ```
    export intern=yy
    echo $intern
    ```
3. unset removes the env var
    ```
    unset intern
    ```
