<p>Welcome to my website~ </p>

<p>This is Yiyang, and you can call me YY. I am a Computer Science graduate student at Columbia University, and I am graduating this December. </p>

<p>I just finished my summer internship at Autodesk, where I worked in the Engineering Practice Group, a group facilitating best engineering practices across Autodesk. I was exposed to agile practices, exploring open/inner source opportunities, test driven development, white board designing, peer programming, CI/CD pipeline and other best practices.</p>

<p>What makes me proud of my internship is bringing value by following these good practices. I have worked on a React web app and had a side inner sourse project came with it. The inner source project is for sharing all the best practices that could help other React develpors inside Autodesk. Even after I finished my internship, I still get updates about people found some solutions they are looking for from the inner source project. I do enjoy the happiness of helping others, and for the greater good, we are trying to make this project open source. </p>
